        	<p>I'm still working on my website, can't say much about how it'll come out but it'll host short (or medium-sized) stories set within my worldbuilding project (no name yet but unofficially (if that matters) I call it "The Heavens"), I have 2 planned out (mostly), but for now you can check out my other stuff!</p>

           	<p>Check out my Neocities page while you're waiting for new stuff here!! Although it's slightly (a lot) outdated, it's set within a place that will not be mentioned within my stories for quite a while - if you'd like to check it out!</p>
