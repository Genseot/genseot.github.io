            <p>Hello!! Welcome to my website!! I'm Genseot, i program and write.</p>
            <p>This site won't have anything yet, still working on it, sorry!</p>
            <p>But what I can tell you is: this website will house my worldbuilding project, playable through short stories centred (usually) around a singular area within the world, with a short story or goal attached to it.</p>

            <h2>Neocities</h2>
            <p>Check out my Neocities page while you're waiting for new stuff here!! Although it's slightly (a lot) outdated, it's still pretty cool, like a little time capsule or whatever from when I was first learning webdev stuff!</p>

            <h2>The Constellarium</h2>
            <p>My first short story for this website - delve within the dream-castle of the Stars, enlist the help of the Ten, and crack open the Dream-Gate to see what lies beyond!</p>
