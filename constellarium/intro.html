			<h2>Awakening</h2>
			<p>I awaken amidst the muck and roots of the Silvered Wood. Above, the moonlight breaks through the dark, fathomless canopy above me, dancing before my eyes. The trees of the wood stand still in silent sentinel, candle-stubs penetrate the crevices of the trees, alit with little, perpetually-dancing flames, fuelled by the corpses of moths, who dance gracefully into the flames that consume them.</p>
			<p>Within these gardens of night I stand alone, among the pale, dancing moonlight, the ambitious, flitting moths, the hungry, illuminating flames. Within the heart of this wood a dream-castle lies, ruled by the Stars - that is where I must go...</p>

			<h2>Explore</h2>
			<p>I must find the dream-castle nestled within the heart of the Wood. But first, I must trudge through the trees and moths, and find something that may steer me the right way.</p>
