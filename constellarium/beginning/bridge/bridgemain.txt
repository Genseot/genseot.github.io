		<h2>The Bridge of Dreams</h2>
		<p>A gigantic black bridge carved of massive basalt bricks - as if they were carved and laid by giants. Inlaid within some of the basalt bricks are little blue crystals - echo-shards, giving off a dim, blue glow to illuminate this path further. Above, the Stars gleam brighter the closer I get to the dream-castle - eagerly awaiting my entrance, with bated breath.</p>
