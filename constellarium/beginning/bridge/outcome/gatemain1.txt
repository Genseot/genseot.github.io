		<h2>A Gateway into Dream</h2>
		<p>I stand before the gates, who stubbornly stay closed. The Stars shine above, and begin to form into Constellations, coreographed, almost - preparing to open the gates; who shall herald me into this winding dream-castle, who shall be the harbinger to my destruction and who shall be the herald to my birth.</p>
