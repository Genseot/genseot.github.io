		<h2>A City Beneath</h2>
		<p>Beneath the oily-black waves I see a city - garlanded in onyx-black and bone-white, lit by pure white candle-flames. Shapes pass through the streets, ephemeral humanoid shapes like the wind itself took form and walked the empty avenues of the city. In the skies above the city--or the water as I see it--tiny, winged things flit across speedily, like little bats, and luminescent things lazily drift among the throng, like little stars.</p>
