		<h2>Disembarking</h2>
		<p>The boat finally arrives. The Boatman tugs on a rope leashed to the quayside of the bridge - this rocks the boat, but fortunately, I am still on it as the Boatman docks. With a gesture of its hand, it permits me ashore onto the quay. The Boatman grabs its paddles and draws away from where I stand, presumably to fetch another dreamer. It regards me with a silent smile and a nod of its head.</p>
