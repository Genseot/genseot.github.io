		<h2>A Clearing</h2>
		<p>Above me, no canopy of tree-branches and leaves block the pale moonlight from settling on the ground. A clearing is rare enough within these woods - I could use this as an anchor, to steady myself in my expeditions through the wood, until I find what I'm looking for.</p>

		<h2>Explore</h2>
		<p>I must find a way through the moon-seared Wood, I need to trek across the roots and mud by foot to find the place I desire.</p>

		<h2>Ponder a Way Through</h2>
		<p>I must find a way through the moonlit Wood, but perhaps I can stay here, and inspiration will strike me under the moonlight.</p>
