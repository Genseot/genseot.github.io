		<h2>Inspiration's Touch</h2>
		<p>I wait under the moonlight, thinking still of the Wood's ways. From the moonlight - inspiration touches me, reaching her hand out of it, revealing a possible route through the Wood. My mind swarms with questions - but this idea defeats all of them. A sudden, divine inspiration? A gift from the heavens? If this route proves to be true - then there must be others like it, waiting for me to learn their ways.</p>
