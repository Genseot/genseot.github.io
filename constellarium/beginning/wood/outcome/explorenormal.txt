		<h2>Choking Canopy, Strangling Roots</h2>
		<p>I walk among the primal ways of the Wood, through the roots that strangle the Earth and the canopy that chokes the Sky. Only trickling rivers of moonlight and the light of candles illuminate my path. Here, the candles are few and far between, I must follow the ways that the Wood sets out for me, crawling through root-mounds and stumbling through tree-clumps and dispersing moth-clots.</p>
