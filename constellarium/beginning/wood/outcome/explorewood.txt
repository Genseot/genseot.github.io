		<h2>Wood-Inscribed</h2>
		<p>I walk among the trees of the Wood, following strange inscriptions on their bark. I follow these inscriptions: the same, repeating pattern on the trees, the branches, the roots - a symbol of a candle's flame. This leads me into the deep reaches of the woods, where the skies are midnight and the Stars are hidden in the gloom of night. At the end of the path the symbols brought me, I come across an interesting sight - a thin copse of trees, but here, there seems to be a dense thicket symbols scratched onto the wood of the trees and even the dirt of the ground.</p>
		<p>I am careful not to disturb any of the markings scratched onto the ground and the trees - if this will help me, no doubt it will help other dreamers find their ways as well. The inscriptions tell the tale of a city once built in the heart of this Wood - the glory the city once had during its majestic reign over the dream-world, and its fall, wrought by "beings not of these heavens". The city was once the beating heart of the Wood - every dreamer would visit this city in their sleep, wherein the centre would lie the Constellarium as it is known today. After this war wrought by those heavenly invaders - the city would be unmade, unbuilt. The only thing that survived - the Constellarium, under the heavy protection and blessings of the Stars.</p>
		<p>The author of this epigraph also includes cryptic directions to the heart of the Wood - stating that the path is different for every dreamer, yet they will all converge in time. I note this, and begin picking my way back to the clearing through the annoyances of the Wood, following the markings back to where they had begun; back towards that clearing.</p>
