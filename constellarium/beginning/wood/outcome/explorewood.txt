		<h2>Wood-Inscribed</h2>
		<p>I walk among the trees of the Wood, following strange inscriptions on their bark. I follow these inscriptions: the same, repeating pattern on the trees, the branches, the roots - a symbol of a candle's flame. This leads me into the deep reaches of the woods, where the skies are midnight and the Stars are hidden in the gloom of night. At the end of the path the symbols brought me, I come across an interesting sight - a thin copse of trees, but here, there seems to be a dense thicket symbols scratched onto the wood of the trees and even the dirt of the ground.</p>
