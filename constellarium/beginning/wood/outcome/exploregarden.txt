Through thicket and treacherous ground, I follow the young moths who have not yet had a taste of this ambrosial nectar. The moths follow a wild and chaotic path - yet I persist through the peril of the Wood to its closely-guarded appetites.</p>

I flit among the moths for a while, learning their secrets to travelling the Wood, before settling upon having a drop of the rich, red nectar of the flowers. A singular plump, red drop -</p>
		<p>Through a red and viscous haze, I awake, sprawled in the grass and roots of the clearing, yet again. I do not remember what transpired, yet I remember more of the moth-secrets of travelling the Wood.</p>
