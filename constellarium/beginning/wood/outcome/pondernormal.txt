		<h2>A Potential Path?</h2>
		<p>I think of potential ways through the Wood. Perhaps there may be a pattern to the ways of travelling through the Wood - and if so, I must find this pattern to break my way through into the heart. I make my way through the labyrinths of memory - of my mind to unravel the secrets of the ways of the Wood, and how they must work.</p>
		<p>I struggle for hours on end trudging through the ways of mind and memory - to see anything resembling what a potential path may be through my experiences through the Wood. I take attention to every miniscule detail of the Wood - yet it yields only little, tiny scraps of knowledge - this is all I've learnt for now, until inspiration strikes.</p>
