		<h2>A Foreword -</h2>
		<p>This is a story of sacrifice, giving up yourself until nothing remains - and transformation, beginning anew through the silence of a death.</p>
		<p><b>DISREGARD THE NEXT SECTION FOR NOW - THIS DEMO ONLY CONTAINS THE FIRST THIRD OF THE STORY, THIS WILL APPEAR IN THE LATTER PARTS.</b></p>
		<p><b>A WARNING -</b> this story has mentions of self-harming, if you do not like this topic but would like to continue - choose the "No SH" option, this will excise all mentions of that. Choosing "Original" will keep that text, though.</p>
