		<h2>A Grand Staircase</h2>
		<p>I travel the shining aisles of the Recordatium, tracing the path to a grand staircase, spiralling up and up into the higher floors of the Recordatium. Although I intend to follow the Constellarium into its roots rather than to its branches - the view from the staircase may yield another fragment of a route through the Recordatium. The staircase grows larger and larger in my vision - its tiny steps multitudinous, it'll take a while to climb up above the shelves, but the vista might help. I finally stand before the steps first ascending.</p>
		<p>Step by step by step I ascend one of the grand, spiralling staircases of the Recordatium. As I get higher - the floors above become more clearer, those grand murals on their underbellies becoming inceasingly coherent; the endless labyrinth below becomes much easier to navigate from a vista such as this. I survey the winding ways of the Recordatium below me, unwinding threads from the labyrinth's yarn, trying to find a way through the labyrinth - to find a way into its depths. The passages and aisles of the shining labyrinth below twine and intersect like the roots of the Silvered Wood - perhaps they will help lead you into the Constellarium's depths? Beyond that, you take note of the visible, surrounding area around the staircase, of which will definitely help in the navigation of the aisles close to the stairway.</p>
		<p>Before I depart from this bird's-eye view, I take a moment to consider the murals that are now more lucid on the underneath of the floors above. They are splashed with a great many colours - though dark blues and blacks consistently penetrate through the other hues. These murals depict affairs, intrigues, wars between the Constellations, endless love, sprawling conspiracies, and bloody wars; all painted within the endless chambers of the Recordatium - a testament to the history and persistence of the Constellations. The way down the stairs is much easier than the way up - I return to the comfortable ground floor of the Recordatium.</p>
