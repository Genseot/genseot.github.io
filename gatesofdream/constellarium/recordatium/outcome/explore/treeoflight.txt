		<h2>The Tree of Light</h2>
		<p>I travel the glistening aisles of the Recordatium following that imagined light residing within its centre. Whisping tendrils of warm, almost-bitter--yet almost-mellow light reach through the aisles, curling around dreamers and shelves alike - blessing all to its touch. I follow these tendrils of light, and as I travel deeper and deeper into the reaches of the Recordatium - the light begins to evoke more primaeval emotions. The adrenaline of the hunt - the warmth of the old light of the Sun - the restless longing we were all born from. These emotions all flicker within me - that light the spark, my mind its tinder; that light the candle, my mind the moth. The aisles of the Recordatium become almost midnight-black - with only the light guiding my way. The aisles twist into shapes more and more familiar within that primordial part of me - the one that lies beneath the light of my reason, inside the forests of my passion. I arrive before the fons et origo of that light - where it resides and radiates its touch--its blessing--its curse.</p>
		<p>Before me lies a gigantic tree of translucent, yellow light, reaching higher than those in the waking world - reaching for the firmament of the infinite library; the Tree of Light. The higher floors part in its wake, railings allow dreamers to gaze upon its beauty. Its boughs are laden heavy with translucent, pale-white fruit - unreachable from here, yet it might just be possible to reach from those higher floors of the Recordatium. Those pale fruits are said to open your mind to knowledge - although that knowledge may drive some to insanity, others to fanatical devotion, and the rest have their minds opened to the light, in quite the literal sense; all yearn for a chance to bite into the succulent fruit of the tree, yet all know better. Below the Tree lies the remnants of the Spark, the seedling the Tree hatched from - yet only what is left of it after its dissolution; impossibly preserved, withstanding the test of time within the Recordatium.</p>
		<p>I approach the Tree--not too close, just in case--and stare into its bark-light. Its light burns your eyes just as the Sun does - yet it allows you to behold its full form and the visions seen within its bark-light. I see fleeting snatches of sights, the most prominent - myself navigating the aisles of the Recordatium, walking a path that seems to be almost-determined. I intently take notes of the snippets of paths I can clearly observe through the almost-distored bark-light. I tear myself away from the visions granted by the Tree - was I this close to its trunk before? I turn around and quickly take my leave, walking through the winding passages of the Recordatium as I pass dreamers fascinated by the Tree's light.</p>
