		<h2>A Reminiscence-Room</h2>
		<p>I travel the gleaming aisles of the Recordatium following stone-staves, crowned with a miscellany of white crystals. These crystals are almost pure white - almost like quartz, emitting a soft, white light; vessel-crystals these are called - these cannot store memory, but can be used for other purposes. These staves serve as markers among the Recordatium - being a guiding hand to wandering dreamers, helping all who follow its path into the places they seek. This time - they lead me to an offshoot-chamber: a reminiscence-room.</p>
		<p>I enter the threshold into the reminiscence-room - a place where dreamers can rest, and reminisce the memories contained within the crystals of the Recordatium. Within the reminiscence-room - on one half lies a miniature library, stacked with crystals and stone desks and benches. On the other half lies windows - stained-glass, stained with the colours of memory-crystals. These capture my interest - some say that your desires are reflected through these windows; this may help me find my way through the Recordatium.</p>
		<p>Those windows of desire reveal an enigmatic sight - multitudes of passages throughout the Constellarium. I don't recognise most of these sights - though a few do seem to reflect the aisles and ways of the Recordatium. I take note of those few sights - they may help me in my endless wandering. I take a minute of refuge here in this silent chamber before my exit back into the shelves of the Recordatium.</p>
