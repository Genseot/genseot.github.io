		<h2>The Heart's Circle</h2>
		<p>I walk the multitudinous shelves of the Recordatium, looking for nothing in particular. I travel through the Recordatium's intricate stonework, its ever-wandering dreamers, its crystal-thronged bookshelves. Wandering the endless labyrinthine library, I find myself within a strange section of the Recordatium...</p>
		<p>The stone brickwork of the Recordatium begins to yield to a primaeval brown stone, one more akin to the depths of a cavern rather than the stone of the Constellarium. Stalagmites and stalactites pierce through the ground below and the ceiling above - each one hollowed out, and in the stead of where the stone would be lie memory-crystals. The memory-crystals on the stalagmites and stalactites are a bright, yet light pink--the hue of pink a human heart would be--each crystal pulses in time with the beating of my heart. This place is lit by wrought-iron braziers, its flames flickering hungrily, yet eternally - the shadows flicker just as the flames do, the shadow dancing along with the light. Etched upon the walls and floors of this aisle are markings of dances and of hearts - inscribed by those who came before - preserved eternally from the sea of time. Through the flickering darkness, above the bookshelves - towards the underbelly of the upper floor - I see those murals of the Recordatium, depicting images similar to those inscriptions. The dances and the arrangements and the hearts and their beating and the sacrifices of both humanity and the Stars are depicted - each performed to preserve themselves; each performed to preserve the world we now know.</p>
		<p>As I traverse deeper into the primaeval parts of the Recordatium, the aisles become more hostile and primal - the stalactices and stalagmites poking out--like teeth--and clashing with one another--like a gnawing maw. The inscriptions become ever-more hastily scrawled, depicting dances even more frenzied than before. At the climax of my travels - it is silent. Nothing but the beating of my heart and the sound of my steps penetrates the silence. As I traverse the teeth of this gaping maw and its deafening silence - I eventually make it through and out of those primaeval, primodial aisles, having learnt a little more knowledge on locales like these.</p>
