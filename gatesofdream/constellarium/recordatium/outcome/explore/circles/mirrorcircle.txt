		<h2>The Mirror's Circle</h2>
		<p>I walk the multitudinous shelves of the Recordatium, looking for nothing in particular. I travel through the Recordatium's intricate stonework, its ever-wandering dreamers, its crystal-thronged bookshelves. Wandering the endless labyrinthine library, I find myself within a strange section of the Recordatium...</p>
		<p>The stone brickwork of the Recordatium begins to yield to ankle-high, sapphiric--yet murky--waters. The bookshelves of this aisle are the same as they always are in the Recordatium  - the memory-crystals on the shelves of this section are a silver-grey--the colour of a silvered, polished mirror--each crystal is meticulously polished - almost mirror-like in how they reflect and refract the light. Scattered about the shelves are mirrors in their multitudes of frames - each one polished to perfection--almost obsessively. This reflectivity is not lost in the water, however - even as murky as it is, being a dark-turquoise hue, it reflects everything, like a watery mirror - as above the water, so within its reflection. Above the mirrors and the bookshelves - towards the underbelly of the upper floor - I see those murals of the Recordatium. They depict images of balance, of harmony, of reflections. The Stars reflecting upon the people of the Earth - keeping a watchful eye to protect the balance that can so easily be disturbed.</p>
		<p>As I traverse deeper into the refracted halls of this aisle, the waters I disturb with every step become less murky here - becoming a purer, deeper sapphiric hue. The frames of the mirrors become more and more opulent and elegant in their gilded frames and their flourished carvings. Through all of these mirrors and water - I alone am reflected within them, my reflection almost exactly doing what I do as a proper reflection does--almost. A quick movement of the eye or the hand betrays what exactly they may be. As I walk the path of my reflections - I eventually make it through and out of those mirrored, reflected aisles, having learnt a little more knowledge on locales like these.</p>
