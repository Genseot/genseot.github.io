		<h2>The Flame's Circle</h2>
		<p>I walk the multitudinous shelves of the Recordatium, looking for nothing in particular. I travel through the Recordatium's intricate stonework, its ever-wandering dreamers, its crystal-thronged bookshelves. Wandering the endless labyrinthine library, I find myself within a strange section of the Recordatium...</p>
		<p>The stone brickwork of the Recordatium begins to yield to a sand-swept desert under a blazing sky. The aisles here are mostly the same as they always are in the Recordatium - though, rather than being of stone - the bookshelves are composed of primarily steel, with tendrils and banners of flame hang off the shelves, swaying in the few fervent winds of the desert. The memory-crystals on the shelves of this section are of a blazing-orange hue--the colour of the heart of a fire--each one gleams, burning fervently like a flame. A gust of wind stirs the sands, carefully lifting a few grains of sand up into the air - the wind's cold touch, a little gift under the baking heat of the Sun. Looking above - the sky is swathed in a flame, rippling and swirling like a regal cloak. Above the bookshelves and through the flickering flame-mantle - towards the underbelly of the upper floor - I see those murals of the Recordatium. They depict images of creation, of destruction, of the change of the forge. The hungry flickering of flames in a forge and the steel-on-steel clashing of an anvil are prevalent throughout the murals.</p>
		<p>As I traverse deeper into the incandescent aisles of the Recordatium, the banners of flame begin to slither across the bookshelves like snakes - eyeing me as I walk past. The air begins to waver, shimmering like the air above a flame - writhing like multitudinous serpents, the heat of the scorching-hot skies begin to become unbearable. As I delve deeper within, rivers of a molten metal snake between the bookshelves of the aisle - snaking towards the heart of a crucible. I trek through the scorching-hot lone and level sands - the heat begins to dissipate, the air begins to cool, the fire begins to become more tame; I eventually make it through and out of those incandescent, molten aisles, having learnt a little more knowledge on locales like these.</p>
