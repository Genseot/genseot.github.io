		<h2>The Threshold's Circle</h2>
		<p>I walk the multitudinous shelves of the Recordatium, looking for nothing in particular. I travel through the Recordatium's intricate stonework, it's ever-wandering dreamers, it's crystal-thronged bookshelves. Wandering the endless labyrinthine library, I find myself within a strange section of the Recordatium...</p>
		<p>The stone brickwork of the Recordatium begins to yield to bizarrely shaped bricks - warped in strange ways, almost as if they were melted. The aisles here are more like a labyrinth - the walls closing in, or widening as I walk past. Inset within these walls are shelves - the memory-crystals on the shelves of this section are a snow-white--the colour of the light at the end of a tunnel--thesr crystals shine bright within these labyrinthine walls, lighting my way throughout the darkness. The labyrinth is set upon by a unnatural, dim cloud of darkness--a darkness like the last moments of dusk, when the Sun still shines, dimly. Here, there are many crossroads and decisions to be made - a regret may form when the path leads to nothing but a sucking snare, a dead-end. Through the heavy darkness and above the walls of the aisle - towards the underbelly of the upper floor - I see those murals of the Recordatium. They depict images of crossroads, of revelations, of regret; a Star and a human have many choices - yet they both can only make one decision. The passing of a threshold of a decision chosen yields many things - yet most prominently it may yield a regret, or a revelation.</p>
		<p>As I traverse deeper, a thick cloak of shadow clouds the air - an unnatural shadow, heavily descending upon the earth--weighing upon me like a heavy blanket; the only thing lighting my way through this darkness are those gleaming crystals on the aisles around me. The halls here become more twisting and serpentine - leading to multitudinous crossroads, dead-ends, winding passageways that seem to have to end; they begin to twist and turn unnaturally, as if the labyrinth were a breathing, living being. Through hours of travel through the knotwork ways, I eventually make it through and out of those winding, labyrinthine aisles, having learnt a little more knowledge on locales like these.</p>
