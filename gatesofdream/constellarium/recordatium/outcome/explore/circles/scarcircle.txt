		<h2>The Scar's Circle</h2>
		<p>I walk the multitudinous shelves of the Recordatium, looking for nothing in particular. I travel through the Recordatium's intricate stonework, it's ever-wandering dreamers, it's crystal-thronged bookshelves. Wandering the endless labyrinthine library, I find myself within a strange section of the Recordatium...</p>
		<p>The stone brickwork of the Recordatium begins to yield to vital, light-red sands before crimson waters. The shelves here are still mostly the same as the rest of the Recordatium - though the only difference being the trickling of blood down the bookshelves, tracing a path between the bricks the shelves are made of. The memory-crystals on the shelves of this section are a deep purple--the purple of a bruise--each crystal here is more opaque than a normal crystal, their insides seeming to be thick - thick as blood. As I walk the blood-red sands, the blood trickling down the bookshelves seem to form into small springs here an there - all heading towards a source. Looking above - small streams and droplets of blood seem to seep through the ceiling, splashing onto the sands--mingling their colour with the hue of other droplets that came before. Above the bookshelves and towards the seeping blood from the skie - towards the underbelly of the upper floor - I see those murals of the Recordatium. They depict images of sacrifice, of battle, of blood; depicting those of both the Stars and humans - the blood the Stars have spilt in their wars, the blood we have sacrificed in conquest.</p>
		<p>As I traverse deeper into the aisle I come across where every river of blood empties into - a great crimson lake. The blood seeping through the ceiling splashes drop by drop into the lake, causing ripples throughout - here, the only sound is the incessant splashing of the droplets of blood into the lake. Here, it is possible to take solace in this uncomfortable quiet - this is the same quiet as one in the site of a battle soon after its ending. I eventually make it through and out of those bloody, carmine aisles, having learnt a little more knowledge on locales like these.</p>
