		<h2>The Candle's Circle</h2>
		<p>I walk the multitudinous shelves of the Recordatium, looking for nothing in particular. I travel through the Recordatium's intricate stonework, its ever-wandering dreamers, its crystal-thronged bookshelves. Wandering the endless labyrinthine library, I find myself within a strange section of the Recordatium...</p>
		<p>The stone brickwork of the Recordatium begins to yield to crudely carved basalt-black brick--the same as the rest of the Constellarium--slick with the white of wax. The shelves here are--of course--similar to the rest of the Recordatium - the only difference being candles stuck into the shelves. - the memory-crystals on the shelves of this section are the yellow-orange of a candle-flame, each glimmering like a little flame. Stuck within the cracks of the bricks on the floor lie candles, lit eternally - their flames dancing, burning perpetually at their wicks. The smoke emitting from these candle-flames choke the air - a thick smoke permeating the aisles--yet the candles light the way. Through the candle-smoke and above the bookshelves - towards the underbelly of the upper floor - I see those murals of the Recordatium. They depict images of what has happened in the past and of what will come in the future through candle-flames - albeit only glimpses.</p>
		<p>As I traverse deeper the candles become more and more frequent - each one dripping wax onto another candle--and another--and another, feeding their flames eternally. Through the flickering lights of some of these aisles, I can see things that have happened in my journey thus far - the Wood, the Sea, the Constellarium's gates - what has already happened. Yet, in other flames, I see things that have not quite happened: halls and passages and places I have not visited yet - insights into what will come. As the airs finally begin to clear, the candles become less and less frequent; I eventually make it through and out of those candle-lit, brumous aisles, having learnt a little more knowledge on locales like these.</p>
