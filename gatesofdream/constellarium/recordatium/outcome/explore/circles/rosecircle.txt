		<h2>The Rose's Circle</h2>
		<p>I walk the multitudinous shelves of the Recordatium, looking for nothing in particular. I travel through the Recordatium's intricate stonework, its ever-wandering dreamers, its crystal-thronged bookshelves. Wandering the endless labyrinthine library, I find myself within a strange section of the Recordatium...</p>
		<p>The stone brickwork of the Recordatium begins to yield to grass, swaying in a soft, imagined wind; vines and brambles choke the shelves of the aisles, crawling about on the floor, like snakes through the grass. The bookshelves begin changing into a tree-like shape, their trunks hollowed out and in place of where the wood would be lie memory-crystals. the memory-crystals on root-shelves are a rose-red--resembling the colour of the roses in the waking world--each one twinkles like a little Star - twinkling like the hope of a desire fulfilled. From the grass and brambles sprout roses as big as my head, ruby-red - dripping with a red liquid--like in those moth-gardens in the Wood--that the ground eagerly soaks up, leaving not even a trace behind. Through the canopy of leaves and vines, above the bookshelves - towards the underbelly of the upper floor - I see those murals of the Recordatium. They depict images of desire, of appetite, of love; some depict those desires and appetites of the Stars, and others depict those of humans - each as wild and primal as the other.</p>
		<p>As I traverse deeper into the flowering parts of the Recordatium, the aisles become wilder and more primaeval - almost like the Wood. The roots of the shelves become more knotted and the brambles permeating the ground become hungrier, making travel precarious; the roses, though, seem to be almost overflowing with their nectar - each little drop being consumed by the hungry earth. As I cleave my path through vines and roots, brambles and roses - I eventually make it through and out of those flowering, hungry aisles, having learnt a little more knowledge on locales like these.</p>
