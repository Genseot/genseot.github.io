		<h2>The Crystal's Circle</h2>
		<p>I walk the multitudinous shelves of the Recordatium, looking for nothing in particular. I travel through the Recordatium's intricate stonework, it's ever-wandering dreamers, it's crystal-thronged bookshelves. Wandering the endless labyrinthine library, I find myself within a strange section of the Recordatium...</p>
		<p>The stone brickwork of the Recordatium begins to yield to a smooth, light-grey stone, one akin to what castles may be built of. Jutting out from patches in the ground are crystalline trees - that same grey stone shaped into trees - each mantled with memory-crystals serving as its leaves--these are the bookshelves of this section. The memory-crystals on the trees are a hot-pink--the colour of iron that had just been removed from a forge--each one gleaming as the Stars do as they wheel high in the night skies. This aisle is a large, winding grove of these crystal-trees, emitting a purple, twinkling light; and other, larger shards of crystals emerge from the stone below in certain parts of this place - resembling the inside of a geode - sharp yet beautiful. Through the twinkling crystals, above the bookshelves - towards the underbelly of the upper floor - I see those murals of the Recordatium. They depict images of the dreams and memories of both the Stars and humans, with memory-crystals and echo-shards abundant throughout those murals.</p>
		<p>As I traverse deeper into these crystalline parts of the Recordatium, the crystal-trees and crystal shards become more abundant throughout the forests, each crystal having more sigils etched upon them - eventually becoming an ocean's worth of memory. Even deeper - the crystal-trees begin to twist into even stranger shapes than normal, becoming more heavily etched and inscribed with the Stars' sigils, the crystal shards begin to reflect my memories on their reflective--yet delicate--surface. As I traverse the twisting crystal-trees and the memories reflected within crystal - I eventually make it through and out of those nostalgic, crystalline aisles, having learnt a little more knowledge on locales like these.</p>
