		<h2>The Rosen Gardens</h2>
		<p>The Rosen Gardens - the Domain of the Rose. Here, under the false-sunlight, the winds softly breeze through the grass and the roses - who sway softly, soft as the winds. Trees above obscure the Stars' gaze--not too unlike the thick canopy of leaves that obscured the skies in the Wood--yet they are less thick and midnight and are almost translucent under the false-light--taking the colour of a vibrant green; the roots of the trees jut out from the ground, twining and interlocking in complex knotwork with brambles and briars before disappearing under the earth.</p>
		<p>The roses here drip with an viscous red syrup that I might find a little familiar - enticing me, yet I can keep enough mind to stay my hand from tasting it. I'm not exactly sure whether the rose or the syrup that drips from its petals emits that fragrant scent - the one that draws me in, almost to tasting that syrup - yet I do know that it is one of the dangers of the Rose. In any case, I should be on the right path in its Domain, I just need to find the heart of these gardens and prepare an offering - an offering that would need to be succulent enough to appease the Rose.</p>
