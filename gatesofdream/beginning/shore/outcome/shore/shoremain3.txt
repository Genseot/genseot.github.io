		<p>I put my hand in my pocket. A freezing-cold circular object awaits. I grip the cold object and reveal it under the starlight. It appears to be a coin, comprised mostly of onyx--black as ink--and bone--white as starlight. The patterns the bone creates on the face of the coin resemble skeletons under waves of black waters. On the reverse, the coin depicts a city beneath the white waves of a black sea - onyx-black buildings gleam under its waves - each one, elegantly flourished with designs of bone.</p>
		<p>As I examine the coin, the Boatman reaches its skeletal fingers out and pockets the coin. It waves to me, allowing me to climb aboard.</p>
