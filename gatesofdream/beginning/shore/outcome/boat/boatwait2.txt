		<h2>The Stars and Moon</h2>
		<p>Above, the Stars gleam brighter than they did in the Wood--like little Suns in the endless heavens. They flit about like little moths, forming into Constellations not seen in the real, waking world; forming into sigils and shapes when they so desire - little dancing lights in the heavens.</p>
		<p>Closer to me, the Moon reflects the light of the Star allowing their light to touch upon this ground - the laws they cast, the principles they embody. The Moon shines ever brighter under the silvered light of the Stars, heralding more of its light to illuminate my path - the herald of darkness in the night--yet also the herald of the light of the Stars.</p>
