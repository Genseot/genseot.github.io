		<h2>A Sunken Citadel</h2>
		<p>A new vista into that city beneath comes into view - a grand citadel beneath the waves cloaked in the crushing black of the deep seas, flourished in elaborate bone-white architecture alongside the grand onyx-black. It glints in the candle-light of the city beneath the waves and the little light of the Moon that reaches the depths. The ceiling of the highest chamber opens to an atrium, allowing me to see whatever happens within. And within, I see a sort of ceremony, or perhaps a ritual.</p>
		<p>I can only see snatches of visions into what they conduct within the citadel beneath the waves: a king, veiled in mottled black and grey sits on an onyx-and-bone throne. A long line of these human-imprints wait in a line before this throne and its king - waiting, but for what? The foremost spirit kneels before the throne - the king is silent, watching. A gesture with their hand and that spirit is whisked away to someplace unknown. Another spirit takes its place, and this one, too, is sent away.</p>
