		<h2>Approaching</h2>
		<p>My steps clack on the stone of the bridge, echoing across its entirety. Here - it is silent. Everything has drawn its breath, waiting for me to enter the dream-castle. I approach - step by step, echo by echo towards the castle, inching ever closer to what might set me free.</p>
		<p>As for what lies above - the Stars--and in turn, the Moon--gleam brighter the closer I approach the dream-castle, eagerly awaiting my entrance with bated breath--like the audience at the moment before the climax of a performance. Yet this is not the climax - but only the crescendo.</p>
