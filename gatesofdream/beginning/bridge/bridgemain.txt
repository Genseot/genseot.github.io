		<h2>The Bridge of Dreams</h2>
		<p>A gigantic black bridge carved of massive basalt bricks - as if they were carved and laid by giants. Carvings flourish the bridge's railings - a miscellany of Stars and Constellations and whatnot are depicted within them. Inlaid within some of the engravings are little blue crystals - echo-shards - each one giving off a dim, blue glow to illuminate this path further under the starlight.</p>
		<p>The dream-castle rises over the horizon - its towers stand tall in their opulent glory, its buttresses elegant in their own ways--and the imperial castle itself lies before me bathed in a pale moonlight like that of the Wood.</p>
