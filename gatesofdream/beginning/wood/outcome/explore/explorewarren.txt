		<h2>Primaeval Scrawlings</h2>
		<p>I travel through the mud and dirt of the Wood following tracks of some indiscernible being - one that must be quite intimate with the Wood's ways and its secret paths. The tracks seem to be uncertain of their true nature, twisting into different shapes with each passing step as if they were uncomfortable with their form. At the end of this primaeval path a yawning, gaping mouth awaits. The entrance to a damp and dank cave of which a creature must reside within, no doubt - but perhaps it may be deep within its winding warrens, dreaming.</p>
		<p>I walk into its warrens, staying near the light of the Moon and the candles of the Wood. Within the entrance of the cave lie scrawlings - primitive drawings of the routes of the tangled Wood. I record some to memory before swiftly leaving, for if the moths of the Wood have a strong appetite - then this must have an appetite stronger and more primal than those of the moths.</p>
		<p>I follow some of these paths the creature scratched. Here, the roots and trees of the Wood are much more kinder than they are than normal, more light seems to break through the thick canopy, more candles light the way. I return to the clearing, and take note of some of the secret paths of the Wood.</p>
