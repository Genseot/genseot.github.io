		<h2>Night's Navigator</h2>
		<p>I ponder of the Moon and the light it reflects. The moonlight moves strange and eerily in the dark of the Wood and of the sky, its beams of light - shivering and swaying pale. As though the Moon is the monarch of night resting upon its throne of dappled shadow and eigengrau - there must be a reason for its light shining this way, must there?</p>
		<p>The light appears to shine brighter sometimes, shimmering and dancing beautifully and gracefully; at other times it might be dull, shivering and dancing sluggishly. This must mean something - the Moon knows night and dream better than most. Perhaps it illuminates the true path through its reflected light? Perhaps it must be my compass that I must follow? My mind swims with questions and the Moon looks on in the endless heavens - perhaps it will be my guide through the ways of the deep, dark wood, and will guide me beyond - this is what I have learnt for now.</p>
